Team papercherry worked with HP to envision and prototype how people will acknowledge each other on special occasions in an increasingly digital world.

Our final design solution is a mobile application that allows an individual to send a meaningful and unique card by creating a digital experience that makes the physical card come alive in the receiverâ€™s hands. This app brings the sender and receiver closer together than ever before, tying the creation of the meaningful artifact and the experience and final reaction into a single entity.

We started with a kick-off meeting in January, where we met with our clients from HP and went over HP's prior work and future vision for the project. As HP had already conducted research looking at the way people sent cards, we wanted to both confirm their findings and discover new potential international markets, younger audiences and males.
