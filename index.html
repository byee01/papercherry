  <p>Team papercherry is developing the greeting card of the future. We're working with HP to envision and prototype how people will acknowledge each other on special occasions in an increasingly digital world.</p>

  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>We started with a kick-off meeting in January, where we met with our clients from HP and went over HP's prior work and future vision for the project. As HP had already conducted research looking at the way people sent cards, we wanted to both confirm their findings and discover new potential international markets, younger audiences and males.</p>
